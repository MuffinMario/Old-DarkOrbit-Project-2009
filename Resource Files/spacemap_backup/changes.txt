- changed all possible joinable ports to 5152 (from several others, so only ONE SERVER at once. thx heaven')
- added an if-clause in the "SET" in file DoAction_32 that now finally turns off the music

01-08-2016-01-25
- no function call of SendtoStream has an individual + "\n" at the end now.

01-08-2016-18-12
- changed direction of map files from swf_global/ to swf_global/files/maps/

02-08-2016-03-32
- changed direction of gate files from swf_global/spacemap/addons to swf_global/files/gates/

05-08-2016-22-59
- fixed the last update from .../gates to .../gates/ (oops :D)
- fixed the neighbours array ([9] and [14] had wrong numbers)

12-08-2016-01-28
- fixed some things a while ago, forgot it though (not that important)
- changed 3 gold goliath positions graphics to fit in now (thx whoever thought about changing them :v)

18-08-2016-00-58
- changed the rocket image missile1 with missile2 (i'm not able to change the sprite itself), because there was a bug where missile1 has the image of missile2 and vice versa
- modified the "v" packet so that instead of hit_verbose (_loc3_[4]) being a string ( if _loc3_[4] == "H" ... else) it is now a boolean and i can call the functions easier
- unimportant packet fixes

19-08-2016-02-58
- changed every S|<id> (select packet) to L|<id> because S| is used in special-item packets and this makes it easier to differ on the server side (L for "lock")

03-11-2016-15-43 
- \frame 10\DoAction_30: in function fastscroll.onPress(): 
	fixed so that the player doesn't stop sending minimap-move packets when the player presses the ship (only stops now when player moves)
  -> BUG (once seen yet, not approved) when player pressed minimap and then clicks somewhere around the the user moves in a quite suspicious manner, if true -> race condition problem
- [NOT IN THIS VERSION INCLUDED] started adding blue goliath, too lazy to put in every SVG file, (its taking too much time for me (10 minutes per frame))
- yandexWinner one item of array changed to 12 because I wanted to see what it looks like, ... its okay

03-11-2016-23-40
- changed move interval from 370 ms to 130 ms (does not seem to affect performance)

03-10-2017-12-44
- fixed a bug that caused not being able to move after pressing logout button (why did they even do that, maybe they even sent a packet to free the player?; g_farming was set to 1 when button is pressed, but never set back to 0)

09-11-2017-19-00
- added a packet that updates HP and SHD (0|A|HLT|hp|hpm|shd|shdm) since the client doesnt seem to update both on attack (unnoticeably) close to each other though the packets being sent taking 5 ms max

12-11-2017-17-53
- Added hotkeys for S|SMB (Numpad 7 + 7) and S|ISH (Numpad 8 + 8)
- Small debug thing from function _root.nana() i wanted to test what it does and forgot to remove it again, just ignore it (0|SUCC)
	as far as I have figured out, it just changes the quality setting things
